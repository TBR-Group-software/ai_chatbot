/// A BLoC that manages voice recording operations and state.
///
/// This BLoC handles the complete voice recording lifecycle including
/// initialization, recording, stopping, and cancellation. It provides
/// real-time updates on recording status, sound levels, and recognized text.
///
/// The BLoC automatically handles microphone permissions, speech recognition
/// initialization, and stream management. It integrates with the domain layer
/// through use cases for clean architecture compliance.
///
/// Key features:
/// * Real-time voice recording with live text recognition
/// * Automatic permission handling and initialization
/// * Sound level monitoring and visual feedback
/// * Robust error handling and recovery
/// * Clean state management with immutable states
/// * Callback support for completion and cancellation
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // In your widget
/// BlocBuilder<VoiceRecordingBloc, VoiceRecordingState>(
///   builder: (context, state) {
///     if (state.isRecording) {
///       return RecordingIndicator(
///         soundLevel: state.soundLevel,
///         recognizedText: state.recognizedText,
///       );
///     }
///     return RecordButton(
///       onPressed: () => context.read<VoiceRecordingBloc>()
///         .add(StartVoiceRecordingEvent()),
///     );
///   },
/// )
///
/// // Starting recording
/// context.read<VoiceRecordingBloc>().add(StartVoiceRecordingEvent());
///
/// // Stopping with callback
/// context.read<VoiceRecordingBloc>().add(
///   StopVoiceRecordingEvent(
///     onComplete: (text) => _handleRecognizedText(text),
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///

/// * [VoiceRecordingState] for available state properties
/// * [VoiceRecordingEvent] for available events
/// * [StartVoiceRecordingUseCase] for recording initialization
/// * [StopVoiceRecordingUseCase] for recording termination
/// * [CancelVoiceRecordingUseCase] for recording cancellation
